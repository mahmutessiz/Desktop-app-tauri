# Your Desktop App with Vue, Vite, Tailwind CSS, SwiperJS, and Tauri

Welcome to this exciting project! This is a desktop application built using a powerful combination of modern web technologies: Vue.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, SwiperJS, and Tauri. 

## Overview

Let's dive into what each technology brings to the table:

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's designed to be incrementally adoptable and can easily scale between a library and a full-featured framework depending on your use case.

- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that offers a faster and leaner development experience. It provides features like hot module replacement and esbuild powered build system to make the development process smooth.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

- **SwiperJS**: The most modern free mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior. It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps.

- **Tauri**: A toolkit that helps developers make secure, light and fast desktop applications with web technologies. Tauri uses a Rust backend to deliver a smaller, faster, and more secure desktop application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run tauri dev`. This will start the Vite server and you can start seeing your changes live as you develop.
4. To build the desktop application, use `npm run tauri build`. This will bundle your code into a small package and use Tauri to create a native application.
